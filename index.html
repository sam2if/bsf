            <strong>Early life</strong> - Steven Paul Jobs was born on February
            24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, U.S. Steve Jobs' mother,
            Joanne Schieble was Swiss-American; his father, Abdulfattah "John"
            Jandali was Syrian. Jobs was adopted at birth. His birth parents
            wanted Steve to be adopted by college graduates, that was not the
            case. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs who promised Steve would
            go to college. Jobs went to Reed College for a semester and then
            dropped out. He spent 18 more months dropping in on more creative
            classes. He also took part in ballet as a child.

            <strong>Founding of Apple Inc.</strong> - Together with Apple
            co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs helped make the idea of the personal
            computer popular in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, still at
            Apple, Jobs was one of the first to see the commercial potential of
            using a mouse to use with the GUI. During this period, Apple had
            hired a number of other people to be president of the company.

            <strong>Out of Apple Inc., NeXT Computer and Pixar</strong> - In
            1985 Apple's Board of Directors fired Jobs from his position with
            the company. He then started NeXT, a computer platform development
            company which dealt with higher education and business markets.
            Apple's 1997 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he
            co-founded where he worked as the CEO of Apple. He was paid $1m per
            year plus stock options. While Jobs was away from Apple, he bought a
            computer animation studio from film director George Lucas called
            Pixar. Jobs later sold Pixar to Disney and gained a seat on the
            Disney board of directors. Their first film from Pixar was Toy Story
            (1995) which was a huge success. Pixar went on to make films such as
            Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), Cars (2006), WALL-E
            (2008), Up (2009), among others. Jobs made more money with Pixar
            than he did during his first stint with Apple.

            few years and had a liver transplant. When he died of respiratory
            arrest caused by pancreatic cancer in 2011 in Palo Alto, California,
